# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

This app lets the user take notes and save them so they can keep track of tasks that need to be completed. There are fields for the note's title and text and both are saved to a .json file for reference.

The delete button doesn't work as intended at this time; notes can only be deleted through editing the .json file directly.
